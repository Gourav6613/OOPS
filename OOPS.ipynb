    "# ans: The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "# 1.Class: A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of properties (attributes) and methods (functions) that the objects \n",
    "# created from the class will have.\n",
    "# 2.Object: An object is an instance of a class. If a class is like a blueprint, then an object is the actual building created from that blueprint. \n",
    "# Each object can have different values for the properties defined in the class.\n",
    "# 3.Encapsulation: Encapsulation means bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. \n",
    "# It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which is known as data hiding. This helps to protect the object's \n",
    "# data from being modified unexpectedly.\n",
    "# 4.Inheritance: Inheritance allows a new class to inherit properties and methods from an existing class. The new class is called the \"child\" or \n",
    "# \"subclass,\" and the existing class is the \"parent\" or \"superclass.\" This helps in code reusability and allows for creating a more specific version \n",
    "# of a class.\n",
    "# 5.Polymorphism: Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" In OOP, it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. \n",
    "# It also allows a single function or method to work in different ways depending on the object it is acting upon."

    "# b) How to Define: Instance methods always take self as the first parameter, which represents the instance of the class.\n",

    "# b) How to Define: Class methods take cls as the first parameter, which represents the class itself. You use the @classmethod decorator to define a \n",
